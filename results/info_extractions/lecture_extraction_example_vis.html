## Video Segment: 72:00 - 75:00

[SLIDE DESCRIPTION]
A timeline showing the evolution of information theory and database concepts, starting from 1914 with &quot;Great Depression&quot; and moving through &quot;Information Theory (by Shannon)&quot;, &quot;Univac I&quot;, &quot;Programmed Record Managers&quot;, and &quot;On-Line Network Databases&quot; up to 1970.

[TRANSCRIPT - 72:01]
People start talking about how should I protect and in the end they become different information theory. A lot of information, for example, take another thing, database. Where the database come from? Why the database design in this one and that and that? Actually, they also have some reason. Maybe that reason go back to the Great Depression in around 1940. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="2" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">People actually do not know the current state and make the wrong judgment. That is history, that trauma lead certain thing. Allow people to thinking about, yes, that is how I need to improve.</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="3" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">Most of the data you try to process also have a context like that way.</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="4" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">So when you try to deal with the data, you have to thinking about that.</span> So for example, right here, we also talking about in the database course, I usually talking about people. Univac people actually have the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="5" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">magnetic tape</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="6" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">So right now you have the disk and but before it&#x27;s utilized punch card.</span> And why they need to talking about magnetic tape? Because it was needed. Why they needed? US census bureau needed. Why? Because they need to do census for the United States. Why they need to do that? Because of the war. So many people die. How do this country&#x27;s economy being rebuilt when all the men was dying in the war field? When they only have the woman in their house, is anything we need to change? So then <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="7" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">if you can combine them, they will make sense. But if you isolate them, from each of them become data, then you will find out that you probably cannot be better than GPT because GPT know a lot more than you.</span>

[SLIDE DESCRIPTION]
A slide titled &quot;Class Lottery&quot; with a QR code for &quot;Distance Learning Students (Valid for 3 minutes only)&quot;.

[TRANSCRIPT - 74:00]
Okay, so here is a class lottery. So when you go to the class lottery right there, and then my answer is... The answer is wars. Just talking about wars. So go to if you are class participation, go to this class model. It&#x27;s been asked. It&#x27;s open up. It&#x27;s just refresh. And that&#x27;s the class lottery. The answer is wars. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="8" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">The QR code only valid for three minutes.</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="9" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">If there&#x27;s any student go to this QR code, the QR code only valid for three minutes.</span> Answer is wars. Okay, so then, uh, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="10" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">if you finish the class one, you can go to this distance learning one for today.</span> Uh, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="11" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">if you participate too, you mean you got two chance.</span> You are allowed to do distance learning student.
