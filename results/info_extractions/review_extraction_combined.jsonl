After \nall, the target has to be convinced he is in a dream (which is itself within another dream). Furthermore, the \nfilm contains some ambiguity regarding what, if any level, was reality. The top level of the dream-within-\ndream hierarchy is presented to the viewer as reality, but, similar to the classic film Dreamscape (dir. \nJoseph Ruben, 1984), there is reason to suspect that even this top level is a dream. The film remains \nambiguous on this matter, and appropriately so, as this ambiguity highlights the ambiguity we must face \nwithin our own lives about what actually is real.\nThe ambiguity about whether our perceived realities are indeed real is a topic of ongoing debate within \nthe philosophy literatures on epistemology and philosophy of mind. A classic thought experiment in this \nrealm is the brain in a vat (Brueckner 2006; Putnam 1981). Here we imagine a human brain placed in a \nvat of liquids containing all the nutrients necessary for the brain to survive and function. The vat also \ncontains connections for sensory input to and information extraction from the brain.

The question here is, how do we know we are not brains in vats? A similar thought experiment \nis the simulation argument (Bostrom 2003). Here, a powerful computer simulation contains simulated \nminds with all the complexity of our own. In parallel with the brain-in-vat thought experiment, the \nquestion here is, how do we not know we are a simulation within a computer program? The simple \nanswer is that we don\u2019t know, and cannot know. While this idea is more fully explored in the movie The \nMatrix (dir. Larry and Andy Wachowski, 1999), Inception raises the idea that if dreams can be that \npowerful \u2013 and that manipulable \u2013 then we may not be able to know whether or not we are in one.\nThe hierarchical structure of dreams within dreams also points to another intriguing theme within the \nfilm: recursion. A sequence of dreams within dreams is itself a recursive phenomenon, but it is not the \nonly one in the film. Within dreams, recursive time sequences can appear through the incorporation of \nmemories into dream scenes. These time loops, the only non-linear movement through time in the film, \nare considered dangerous. For this reason, architects are instructed to keep real places out of dreams so as \nto avoid triggering memories in dream participants and particular targets.

This marks an historic moment of Ego formation \nfor human beings. The Ego here is the part of the mind that negotiates between what the individual wants \nto be for herself and what the individual perceives that society wants her to be. Likewise, the individual \nrecognizing her mirror reflection experiences both her internal cognitive self and her external visual self \nas it is seen by others (see also Pronin 2008). Thus, for the architect to shatter the mirror and step into her \nreflection world is, from this Lacanian perspective, a fusion of the self as perceived by itself and the self \nas perceived by others \u2013 a fully negotiated Ego. That this momentous event occurs within the space of a \ndream (on which see Fink 1995, 189) suggests the possibility, within the realm of the dream, of escaping \nthe psychological shackles constructed by our waking minds.
